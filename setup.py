setup.py is the build script for setuptools. It tells setuptools about your package (such as the name and version) as well as which code files to include.

Open setup.py and enter the following content. Update the package name to include your username (for example, example-pkg-theacodes), this ensures that you have a unique package name and that your package doesnâ€™t conflict with packages uploaded by other people following this tutorial.
